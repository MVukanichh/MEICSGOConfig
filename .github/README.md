<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

MVukanichh's Counter-Strike 2 Config is a config template. It's main purpose is to serve as an template for personal customization as it is well-documented and easy to read and edit, since it's organized into multiple config files, categorizing configs into separate files.

> [!NOTE]  
> While it's both intended to and recommended to edit configs provided in this template, it is also possible to use them as-is, since MVukanichh's CS2 Config(s) strive to have out-of-box optimized and (hopefully) best configured settings.

---

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

As stated previously, MVukanichh's CS2 Config can be used as-is, but it is highly recommended to edit to suit user's preferences.

### Prerequisites

In order for MVukanichh's CS2 Config to be usable, next software should be installed beforehand:

- Counter-Strike 2
- Notepad++
	- Notepad++ is used to edit Configs to match users' preferences. It is recommended to use Notepad++ instead of Windows Notepad, as it has better formatting and better readability.

### Installation

MVukanichh's CS2 Config includes optimized config templates, as stated before, but also closed-caption file used as a replacement for text mod and optimized launch options, thus two separate installation processes must be followed:

> [!NOTE]  
> As of 14th of December 2023, Text Mods have been disabled in Counter-Strike 2. In order to work around that, closed-caption file must be created and used instead.

#### Downloading the ZIP File
